# TicTacToe_First_Project
After learning python for a couple of months, I made my first 'big' project, a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the terminal. I chose this project because it was the next chapter in my futurecoder.io course and I wanted to give it a try all by myself before I continue with the course. Overall, it was a fun and challenging exercise for me.
