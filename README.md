# TicTacToe_First_Project
After learning python for a couple of months, I made my first 'big' project, a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the terminal.
I chose this project because it was the next chapter in my futurecoder.io course and I wanted to give it a try all by myself before I continue with the course.
I did it in quite a different way than the course suggested, especially with regard to the function that checks for winners, I think I can improve on that.
Overall, it was a fun and challenging exercise for me. I worked on this project for about 10-12 hours (3 days, 3/4h per day).

*1.
I made a few changes in order to add more features to the game to make it work better.
I added functions to check for wrong input from the user, also to not allow a player to use a space that was already used and to check if there is a stalemate between players.

*2.
I changed the stalemate condition to check after checking for winners (got wrong endings) and made the player function to work for both players. 
Finally, I made the game replayable at the end and added docstrings to explain what everything does.
